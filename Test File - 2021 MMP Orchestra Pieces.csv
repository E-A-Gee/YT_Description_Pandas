Blackberrying,MMP3576,6,2021,"Copyright © 2021 by My Music Publisher, LLC
All rights reserved.","Composer Suhaila Parris wrote Blackberrying based on the Sylvia Plath poem of the same name. With its long narrative lines, ""Blackberrying"" takes the listener on a journey from an external experience to an internal one. Immersed in the details of her blackberry-picking expedition, Parris uses language and imagery in a very controlled way, leading the reader to see that every word has a possible double meaning and every image may bring to mind something internal, some inner working. With room for interdisciplinary lessons, this is a poignant  must-play for any advanced ensemble looking to take on a challenge!",45,Suhaila Parris,,"My Music Publisher, LLC.",D major,q = 52,String Orchestra
